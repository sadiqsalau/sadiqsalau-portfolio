      <p>
        <strong>Pluxscore</strong> is a progressive web app built for sports
        fans â€” offering live scores, match highlights, real-time chat, and
        social features in one place. It was developed under{" "}
        <HyperLink target="_blank" href="https://pluxmedianetwork.com.ng">
          <strong>Plux Media Network</strong>
        </HyperLink>
        .
      </p>

      <p>
        This project has played a big role in my growth ðŸ«¡ as a Software
        Engineer. I <strong>rebuilt it multiple times</strong> over the years â€”
        from raw PHP to CodeIgniter, and finally to{" "}
        <strong>React and Laravel</strong> â€” each version reflecting a new phase
        of learning and improvement.
      </p>

      <p>
        I handled everything from backend to frontend, with Laravel Echo
        handling the real-time layer. It runs as a PWA, optimized for mobile,
        though not fully offline.
