        <strong>Stellar Cargo</strong> is the first Progressive Web App I

        I built it out of necessity. Managing multiple Stellar wallets manually
        was frustrating ðŸ«©, and I wanted a way to view my total balance across
        all of them, merge or split tokens with a tap, and avoid repetitive
        import steps.

      <p>
        The response was validatingâ€”it proved there was demand, and it gave me
        the motivation to keep creating more offline-first PWAs for real-world
        problems.

        It supports multiple wallets, token splitting and merging, and works
        fully offline. You can also sync your data to Google Drive for backup .
