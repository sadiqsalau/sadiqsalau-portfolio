      <p>
        Keza is a fully offline Progressive Web App for generating multiple
        crypto wallets â€” including EVM, Solana, and TONâ€”along with secure 12- or
        24-word mnemonics.
      </p>

      <p>
        I built Keza out of <strong>personal necessity</strong>. I needed to
        create over 20 wallets ðŸ¤¯ and wasn't about to go through that one-by-one
        on MetaMask or Phantom. With Keza, I could batch-generate, review, and
        export all at once â€” no Wallet extension required, no internet needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        It supports JSON, TXT, CSV, and XLS exports, making it ideal for
        generating wallets for example: savings, rent, spending, and more.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was built with <strong>React</strong>, <strong>TailwindCSS</strong>{" "}
        and Wallet SDKs like <strong>ethers.js</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>solana-web3.js</strong>.
