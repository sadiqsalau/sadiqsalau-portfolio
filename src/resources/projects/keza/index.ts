  fullDescription:
    "Keza is a fully offline Progressive Web App that enables users to generate multiple cryptocurrency wallets, including EVM-compatible, Solana, and TON wallets.\nIt also supports creating secure 12- and 24-word mnemonics with batch generation and export in JSON, TXT, CSV, or XLS formats.\n\nI built Keza to simplify the wallet creation process for experienced users like myselfâ€”eliminating repetitive backup confirmations and allowing fast, organized generation of separate wallets for savings, rent, spending, and more, all without compromising privacy or security.",
