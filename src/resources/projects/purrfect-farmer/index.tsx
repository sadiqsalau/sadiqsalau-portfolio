      <p>
        <strong>Purrfect Farmer</strong> is hands down one of my most{" "}
        <strong>ambitious and loved üòç</strong> projects. It started as a simple
        idea ‚Äî to automate Telegram airdrops like{" "}
        <HyperLink target="_blank" href="https://blum.io/">
          <strong>Blum</strong>
        </HyperLink>
        ,{" "}
        <HyperLink target="_blank" href="https://notpixel.org/">
          <strong>Not Pixel</strong>
        </HyperLink>{" "}
        etc. ‚Äî but quickly grew into a full ecosystem of tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        I built the main Chrome extension to handle multi-account automation
        directly in the browser. It now supports parallel farming across Chrome
        profiles, with each profile running its own instance of the extension.
        This means you can farm multiple accounts simultaneously, all managed
        through a single interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've pushed over 80,000 lines of code to this repo alone, not counting
        other tools like{" "}
        <HyperLink
          href="https://github.com/purrfect-farmer/purrfect-whiskers"
          target="_blank"
        >
          Purrfect Whiskers
        </HyperLink>
        , and{" "}
        <HyperLink
          href="https://github.com/purrfect-farmer/purrfect-fly"
          target="_blank"
        >
          Purrfect Fly
        </HyperLink>{" "}
        (for cloud farming).
      </p>

      <p>
        This isn't just a script ‚Äî it's a fully featured suite for automation.
