  overview:
    "PWABucket is a curated app store built specifically for high-quality Progressive Web Apps.\n\nI created it as a centralized hub to showcase offline-first tools like Keza and Stellar Cargo — apps that prioritize performance, privacy, and usability without relying on a constant internet connection.\n\nIt’s designed to make discovering and sharing production-ready PWAs easier for both developers and end users.",
