      <p>
        <strong>PWABucket</strong> is an open-source app store dedicated to
        Progressive Web Apps â€” built to spotlight tools that run offline,
        prioritize privacy, and deliver a seamless experience without needing a
        native install.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've had the idea since 2023, but it fully took shape when I began
        releasing my own apps like{" "}
        <HyperLink target="_blank" href="https://keza.pwabucket.com">
          <strong>Keza</strong>
        </HyperLink>{" "}
        and{" "}
        <HyperLink target="_blank" href="https://stellar-cargo.pwabucket.com">
          <strong>Stellar Cargo</strong>
        </HyperLink>
        . Every PWA I build now gets published here under the{" "}
        <HyperLink target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pwabucket">
          <strong>PWABucket</strong>
        </HyperLink>{" "}
        GitHub organization.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's a personal platform to unify, showcase, and maintain all my
        offline-first work in one place.
      </p>

      <p>
        For this, I used <strong>React</strong> and <strong>TailwindCSS</strong>{" "}
        primarily, there's no backend involved. The app is fully static and
        hosted on GitHub Pages.
