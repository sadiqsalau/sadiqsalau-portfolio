      <p>
        I built <strong>AiEarn Tracker</strong> to help a friend who wanted to
        monitor his investments but wasn't comfortable running scripts like I
        do. So I made something visual — a simple, browser-based app.

        It allows you to log daily investments, track progress, and simulate
        future returns with ease. The built-in calendar makes navigation
        effortless, and you can pick any date to see how things play out over
        time.

        It also has support for Google Drive Sync just like{" "}

        .
      </p>

      <p>
        Like every PWA on <strong>PWABucket</strong>, I built this solo —
        keeping it lightweight, offline-first, and focused on usability for
        non-technical users.
