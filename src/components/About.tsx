      <p>
        I'm a self-taught full-stack web developer based in ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ Nigeria, with
        years of experience building fast, offline-first web applications. I
        specialize in React, Laravel, and Node.js (Fastify), and I care deeply
        about performance, accessibility, and clean, maintainable code.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though I don't hold a formal degree, I've spent years relentlessly
        studying, reading technical books, and building real-world projects. I
        learn fast, stay current, and don't cling to outdated tools or trends.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether it's a PWA, custom backend, or interactive UI, I focus on
        delivering lightweight, reliable solutions that work â€” even offline.
