          <p>
            I'm a self-taught full-stack web developer based in ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ Nigeria with
            several years of experience building fast, offline-first web
            applications. I specialize in React, Laravel, and Node.js (Fastify),
            and I care deeply about performance, accessibility, and clean code.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though I don't have a formal degree, I've relentlessly studied, read
            dozens of technical books, and built real-world projects from
            scratch. While most of my projects were built manually, I now also
            leverage <LuSparkles className="inline-flex size-4" /> AI tools like
            GitHub Copilot for code and Bolt/Lovable for no-code workflows â€”
            helping me move faster without compromising quality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether it's a custom backend, interactive frontend, or lightweight
            PWA, I aim to deliver reliable, maintainable solutions that just
            work â€” even offline.
