      <p>
        I'm a self-taught full-stack web developer based in ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ Nigeria with
        several years of experience building fast, offline-first web
        applications. I specialize in React, Laravel, and Node.js (Fastify), and
        I care deeply about performance, accessibility, and clean code.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite not having a formal degree, Iâ€™ve relentlessly studied, read
        dozens of technical books, and built real-world projects using modern
        web tools. I adapt quickly, stay up to date, and never get stuck on old
        habits or outdated tech.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether it's a PWA, a custom backend, or an interactive frontend, I
        focus on delivering lightweight, maintainable solutions that just work â€”
        even offline.
