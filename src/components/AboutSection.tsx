            I'm a self-taught Software Engineer based in ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ Nigeria with several
            years of experience building software applications. I am the Creator

            Though I don't have a formal degree in Computer Science, I've gained
            a strong knowledge base through relentless self-study. I've studied
            programming paradigms, read in-depth official documentation on
            various programming languages, followed course-like structures
            across languages and frameworks, and built real-world projects from
            the ground up.
          </p>

          <p>
            I specialize in building a variety of apps â€” from desktop
            applications and progressive web apps to Chrome extensions and
            application backends.
          </p>

          <p>
            While my primary focus is on application development, I've also
            designed and built a few standalone websites. These were mostly
            client projects, where I applied the same principles of performance,
            simplicity, and attention to detail.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also enjoy teachingâ€”I've led sessions at{" "}

            for students preparing for CS degrees, showing them how to grasp
            core programming concepts across languages. I've also run a
            beginner-friendly Python course for kids during the holidays.
